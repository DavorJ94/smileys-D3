# Smileys/Emojis created in D3 JavaScript visualization library

All smileys are drawn directly in JavaScript.

Main goal was to get familiar with the visualization library and to have fun making it.

Basically, each smiley represents and SVG which is drawn using circles, lines, rectangles, etc., with different coordinates.

CSS flexbox is used for responsive arrangement of each SVG element.
